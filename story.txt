Marshal walk into the woods. Then he fell into the river. Marshal doesn't know how to swim, so he struggled to get to the river sides. Luckily Marshal was able to grab on to a tree brand nearby.
He screamed in triumph as he exited from the river and he was now saved. He went home and lived happily ever after.
Then he got afraid of the woods and river, so he could never go back to the woods to pick up his programming homework.
